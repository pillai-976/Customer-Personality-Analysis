# Customer-Personality-Analysis

<p>Customer segmentation, also known as market segmentation, identifies customer groupings that are related in one or more ways. This categorization will facilitate in optimising 
marketing to each category, ensuring that each customer receives the most relevant and appropriate offers, maximising the value of each customer in the firm. Customers can be classified 
based on their demographics, behaviour, lifestyle, psychographics, value, and so on. Using customer segmentation in marketing will help in targeting the right people with the right product message. 
This will result in successful marketing campaigns.</p>

<p>For the implementation, RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is performed on transactional data initially, which is then extended to cluster the customers using the traditional K-Means algorithm and 
finally Apriori algorithm is used to find the association between the products. By analysing different groups of customers, the target customers can be identified properly.</p>
